Browser Resize Images

== Description ==

Very useful WordPress plugin to resize images before they are being uploaded. Just drag and drop big images and don't worry about your bandwidth or server space usage.

Everything is configured in "Settings" > "Media".

It is using power of modern browsers to do the job - Chrome and Firefox would use HTML5 method and other browsers - Flash.
Generally it looks like Chrome is the best for the job ([plupload.com](http://www.plupload.com/ "plupload.com"))
